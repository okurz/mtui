This directory contains helper programs/additional checks that are used by the 
Maintenance Test Update Installer.

Each helper falls into exactly one of the following categories:

1) to be run before and after the update

These helpers look for errors in an installed system and print errors to STDERR
and warnings and info to STDOUT (when executed by mtui STDERR and STDOUT are
captured in the caller's current directory as *.err and *.out).

The return status is undefined.

A good example for such a helper is ./check_from_same_srcrpm.pl.

Since some errors will always be present in a system (not fixed on purpose, fixed
by a future update etc). these helpers should be executed before and after
applying the update to have a chance of detecting regressions/improvements. 
 
2) to be run on output gathered from helpers from category 1

These helpers take the output of helpers from category 1 before and after
applying an update and look for both new errors and gone errors.
New errors are reported on STDERR.
Gone errors are reported on STDOUT.

The return status is 1 if new errors appeared and otherwise 0.

FAQ:

Q: What if I only want a script that is executed after an update ?
A: This is a category 1 script. If executed under the control of mtui then
   configure mtui to only run it after the update.

Q: Which helpers are planned/not implemented yet?
   a) inspecting the zypper install log for errors (category 1)
   b) (be innovative :)

Q: What is doit.sh for ?
A: A way to launch the scripts outside of mtui, e.g. to validate your system
   before/after huge updates or to use the checks on platforms that are yet not
   supported by mtui.

Q: What if I hit a bug ?
A: Report it to BNC, SUSE Tools -> Testenvironment -> MTUI
