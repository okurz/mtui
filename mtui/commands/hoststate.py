    A host set to "Enabled" runs all issued commands while a "Disabled" host
    or a host set to "Dryrun" doesn't run any command on the host.

    The difference between "Disabled" and "Dryrun" is that on "Dryrun"
    hosts the issued commands are printed to the console while "Disabled"
    doesn't print anything.

    Additionally, the execution mode of each host could be set
